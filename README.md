Terraform KodeKloud Engineer Program
Terraform – KodeKloud Engineer Tasks
This repository contains solutions, configurations, and notes for Terraform‑based tasks completed as part of the KodeKloud Engineer program. Each task focuses on real‑world infrastructure automation scenarios, using Terraform to provision and manage cloud resources in a reproducible and scalable way.

The goal of this repository is to provide clean, well‑documented examples that demonstrate best practices in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), including modular design, state management, and environment‑specific configuration.

Each task folder contains:

1. Terraform configuration files (main.tf, provider.tf, etc.)

2. Task‑specific documentation

3. Outputs or notes where relevant

🧰 Prerequisites
Before running any Terraform configuration in this repository, ensure the following tools are installed:

1. Terraform (v1.0+ recommended)

2. AWS CLI (if interacting with AWS or LocalStack)

3. LocalStack (for local AWS emulation, used in several KKE tasks)

4. Docker (required for LocalStack)

📚 Learning Focus
These tasks reinforce core Terraform skills:

1. Resource creation and dependency management

2. Working with providers (AWS, LocalStack)

3. Using variables, outputs, and modules

4. Managing state safely

5. Writing clean, reusable IaC

🤝 Contributions
This repository is primarily for personal learning, but improvements, suggestions, and discussions are always welcome. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
